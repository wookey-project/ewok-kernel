What is EwoK ?
--------------

EwoK is a microkernel targeting micro-controllers and embedded systems
aiming at building secure and trusted devices.

Drivers are hold in userspace. Unlike most of
other microkernels, the goal is to support complex drivers (ISO7816,
USB, CRYP, SDIO) while achieving high performances.

What makes EwoK secure?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EwoK is a microkernel enforcing strict isolation between tasks and device
drivers and providing strict access control to physical resources (devices,
etc.) and strong enforcement of the least privilege principle.

EwoK is also implemented in Ada/SPARK, a strongly typed language often used
in highly critical domains (avionic, railway systems, space, etc.) to build
safe and secure software.

Some other security features provided by EwoK:

   * Strict memory partitioning
   * Strict partitioning of physical resources (devices, etc.)
   * Fixed permissions management, set at compile time and easily verifiable
   * Stack smashing protection
   * Heap/Stack smashing protection
   * Proved W^X memory mappings
   * Strict temporal separation between declarative phase and execution phase

Performances
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike other microkernels, EwoK allows userland drivers to use
DMA, GPIOs and EXTIs with the help of some specific syscalls.
Such interfaces are directly implemented in the kernel, in order to
achieve better performance. Indeed, some hardware need a very
responsive software and such responsiveness can not easily be
achieved in a typically minimalistic microkernel (like the ones from the L4 family).


EwoK architecture
-----------------

Kernel architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The kernel is divided into two main components: the **libbsp** and the
**kernel** parts.

The *libbsp* is the hardware abstraction layer, hosting all the low level and
arch-specific drivers (MPU, GPIOs, timers, DMAs, etc.).
The *libbsp* is itself separated in two blocks:

   1. *SoC-specific drivers*, such as DMA or GPIO support for the STM32F407 board
   2. *Core-specific drivers*, such as MPU support for the Cortex-M4 ARMv7m
      micro-architecture

The *kernel* part contains all specific high level content (scheduling, task
management, syscalls, etc.) and uses the libbsp as a hardware abstraction for
any low-level interaction.

Drivers
^^^^^^^

   :align: center

The :ref:`lib_std` (*libstd*) is a C standard library that can be used
by the user tasks (and hence the userspace drivers).
Like the *libc* for *UNIX*-like systems, it implements some useful functions.

The **drivers** are written as userspace libraries. They depend on the *libstd*,
and may sometimes depend on each others. Here is the list of the existing
drivers.

**Libraries** bring various userspace features with arch-independent
implementations.


EwoK API
--------

EwoK is tuned for high performance embedded systems.
The whole microkernel architecture and the provided API are
specifically designed for this purpose.
Note that for these specific performance constraints, EwoK
is not a full-IPC driven microkernel, like the L4 family.

The EwoK API is described here:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   Syscalls <syscalls>
   Using devices from userland <devices>
   Permissions <perms>
